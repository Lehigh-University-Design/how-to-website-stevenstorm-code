<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened</li>
<li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 cups chocolate chips </li>
</ul>
<h3>Insructions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
</li>
  <li>Cream the Butter and Sugars:
In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, packed brown sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.
</li>
  <li>Add Eggs:
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the batter is well combined.
</li> 
  <li>Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
</li>
  <li>Add Chocolate Chips:
Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon. Make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
</li>
  <li>Scoop the Dough:
Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some space between the cookies to allow for spreading.
</li> 
  <li>Bake the Cookies:
Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. Remember that cookies will continue to bake a little after you take them out of the oven due to residual heat.
</li> 
  <li>Cool and Enjoy:
Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
    
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Serve:</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>Once the cookies are completely cool, they are ready to be enjoyed! Serve with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.
</li> 
  </ul>
